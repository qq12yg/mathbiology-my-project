Math5110 code for paper simulation

Hi Professor,

From untitled2.m to untitled7.m(there are six files in total), they are all the simulations about the figures in the paper I chose. The paper link is https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-013-0746-7. You can check it.

Notice: 
untitled2.m is the simulation(replicate) for the first figure in the paper
untitled3.m is the simulation(replicate) for the second figure in the paper
untitled4.m is the simulation(replicate) for the third figure in the paper
untitled6.m is the simulation(replicate) for the fourth figure in the paper
untitled5.m is the simulation(replicate) for the fifth figure in the paper
untitled7.m is the simulation(replicate) for the sixth figure in the paper

All the code(programming) file you can dircetly run and get the corresponding figure.
And the code for this paper is NOT publicly available, all programming work is my own. You check and compare the these figures with the figures in the paper, they are almost same, and they are the replication of all the figures in the paper.
